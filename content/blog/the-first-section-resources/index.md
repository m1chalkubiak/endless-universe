The first section that I decided to focus on will be resources - more in the sense of knowledge resources that can be built on later in the project. So it will be a kind of knowledge base from which subsequent stages of work and decisions will result.

I will start with the planets in our solar system and the elements that are the "foundation" of the universe we know.
