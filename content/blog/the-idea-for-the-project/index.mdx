The whole idea for the Endless Universe project came as a result of interest in the procedural generation subject and willing to expanding my knowledge and experience in the use of new tools and libraries.

I want to explore the topic and the possibilities that procedural generation offers, as well as its advantages and disadvantages. Checking as far as it is possible to use machine learning in this process, I feel that it will be fun and good opportunity to learn new interesting things.

The cosmos, other planets, and the endless universe immediately seems to be the perfect subject for such a project.
